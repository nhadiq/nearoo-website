INCOMPLETE ORDER FULFILLMENT / SUBSTITUTION</p>

		<p>The
primary objective of Nearoo is to deliver all the products ordered in the right
quantity and to a high-quality standard. User acknowledges that the Groceries
are subject to stock availability and to human errors. Nearoo reserves the right
to amend your order in whole or in part, at any time and without liability or
compensation remove any item that is out of stock, damaged, spoiled, or
unavailable for any other reason, to successfully complete your order. It’s in
our best intention to maintain the replaced item’s price the same as per the
brand you ordered but in case of a higher valued replacement, the price may
increase. We do our best to ensure that all items shown on our website are
available to order. If, however any product you order is out of stock or
unavailable we may send you a push notification enabling you to select a
substitute. If an item is not delivered, despite being billed, the amount in
question will be credited to the User at a reasonable time after Nearoo becomes
aware of this. No subsequent delivery is obligatory to be made, and the
customer is not entitled to claim any further compensation. If for any reason
beyond our reasonable control, we are unable to supply a particular item, we
will not be liable to the User. Please note that we will attempt to send the
User push notification of substitute products in the event that selected
products are unavailable, the User may reject these substitutes. Although we
will always try to cater for your orders, an order of unusually large
quantities of different or one product can only be fulfilled at the discretion
of the Shop.</p>

		<p>Nearoo
reserves the right to forward a user order to another shop than the one
initially selected from the user without informing the user in the event that the
initial shop fails to fulfil the order. In this case of the new shop the total
value of the goods ordered should be the same or lower than the value as per
the pricelist of the initial shop. The payment method will remain the same.
